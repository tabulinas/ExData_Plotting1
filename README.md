## Course Project 1 (Exploratory Data Analysis course)

THis analysis uses the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" to examine 
how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
For this four plots are reconstructed and saved to png files.

For every plot there are a script and png file in this repository.

To execute script please copy r scripts in your working directory
and execute
(if you want to create png file, put if_write_png_file = TRUE as an argument)

# First plot:
source("./plot1.R")
plot1()
# Second plot:
source("./plot2.R")
plot2()
# Third plot:
source("./plot3.R")
plot3()
# Fourth plot:
source("./plot4.R")
plot4()
