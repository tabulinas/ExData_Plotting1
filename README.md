## Course Project 1 (Exploratory Data Analysis course)

THis analysis uses the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" to examine 
how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
For this four plots are reconstructed and saved to png files.

For every plot there are a script and png file in this repository.

To execute script please use command:

# source("./plot1.R")
# plot1()
